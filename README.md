1. Currently application does not support updating stocks through the UI. Backend changes are required to change values.
2. There is no function to dim the display if the user is away for an extended duration. This would be ideal to reduce brightness in the night.
3. The homepage needs to have glances into the calendar and stock screens
4. The weather API predictions need to be added to the weather widget
5. The weather screen needs a table of forecasted data
6. The weather screen needs correct minumum and maximum temperature data. The openweathermap API does not provice this information in the free plan
