Application is capable of retrieving time, stock and weather APIs.

1. Currently application does not support updating stocks and calendar through the UI. Backend changes are required to change values.
2. There is no function to dim the display if the user is away for an extended duration. This would be ideal to reduce brightness in the night.
3. The calendar API has not been added to the calendar widget screen
4. The weather API predictions need to be added to the weather widget
5. The UI elements need to be re-adjusted to account for larger temperature numbers
